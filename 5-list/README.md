<h2> What is this? </h2>
<p>This is fastest list structure that you've ever seen. With graph visualisation!</p>
<h2> Why it is so fast? </h2>
<p>Because all operations in this structure does not depend on the list length. All operation like insert, erase have O(1) asymptotics.</p>
<h2> What about graphic visualisation? </h2>
list has func ListGraphDump, that creates list_graph.gv file that you can compile in your bash with command:
<i>"dot -T png list_graph.gv -o image_name.png".</i> 
<p>And then you can open image_name.png and see your list visualisation!</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

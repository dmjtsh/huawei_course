<h2> What is this? </h2>
This is fastest list structure that you've ever seen. With graph visualisation!
<h2> Why it is so fast? </h2>
Because all operations in this structure does not depend on the list length. All operation like insert, erase have O(1) asymptotics.
<h2> What about graphic visualisation? </h2>
My list has func ListGraphDump, that creates list_graph.gv file that you can compile in your bash with command "dot -T png list_graph.gv -o image_name.png
". And then you can open image_name.png and see your list visualisation!
Have fun!

<h1>DIMASS (DIMa's ASSembler)</h1>
<h2> What is This?</h2>
<p> This is project that compile programs on my own assembler language and then run it!</p>
<h2> How to write programs? </h2>
<p> To write your first porject on DimAs you need to write it on txt file and then Compile with Assembler programm </p>
<p> Then you need to run it with CPU program, simple as hell! </p>
<p> There are some examples of programs in folder "examples" in assemler folder </p>
<h2> Some words about DimasLIB </h2>
<p> This lib contains Unkillable Stack from previos projects, and TextInfo structure that help me process file in assembler, also there are some utilities that you can see by yourself </p>
<h2> Usage: </h2>
<p> You can write down any program you want, because this language is Turing filled, ~~happy sufferings!~~ </p>
